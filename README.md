# vf-apps-agents
This repo will define some requirements for apps for both individual (personal) agents as well as organizational agents.

Agent apps are required for [agent-centric computing](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-apps-agents/wiki/Agent-centric-computing). They will be the main apps in such configurations, and the agents will be the selectors and users of all the other apps.

[A personal Agent app](https://github.com/opencooperativeecosystem/agent) has already been started and is in daily use in FairCoop.going through feedback loops with users.
