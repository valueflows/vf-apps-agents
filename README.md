# vf-apps-agents
This repo will define some requirements for apps for both individual (personal) agents as well as organizational agents.

Agent apps are required for [agent-centric computing](https://github.com/valueflows/vf-apps-agents/wiki/Agent-centric-computing).

[A personal Agent app](https://github.com/opencooperativeecosystem/agent) has already been created and is in use in FairCoop.
